package structure
//validation ensures both that sentences to be learned are decently well-formed
//and that sentences produced are of reasonable quality


//before displaying a sentence, iterate through its tokens and check them against the
//non-native dictionary to set appropriate capitalisation

//as part of learning a sentence, break it apart with the native dictionary and learn
//capitalisation for non-native words



//output and input sentences can't start with a punctuation-mark
